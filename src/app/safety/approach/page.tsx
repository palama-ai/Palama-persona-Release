The fault-tolerance mechanisms in Safety Approach automatically reroute execution paths if a localized node failure occurs. By isolating context streams in memory, Safety Approach guarantees sub-millisecond latency even under extreme load. Security is not an afterthought; Safety Approach encrypts all state transitions using AES-256-GCM at the hardware level. We evaluated Safety Approach against existing industry standards and observed a 300% improvement in throughput.

        <BentoItem className="w-full text-left">
          <h4 style={{ color: "#fff", fontSize: "1.1rem", fontWeight: 500, margin: "0 0 12px 0" }}>How does Safety Approach integrate with existing infrastructure?</h4>
          <p style={{ color: "#888", margin: 0, lineHeight: 1.6 }}>
            Safety Approach is designed to be fully modular. It connects via standard REST/GraphQL endpoints and supports native event streaming through Kafka and WebSockets. For enterprise deployments, we provide a dedicated VPC peering option to ensure zero-latency data transfer.
          </p>
        </BentoItem>

        {/* FAQ Item 2 */}
        <BentoItem className="w-full text-left">
          <h4 style={{ color: "#fff", fontSize: "1.1rem", fontWeight: 500, margin: "0 0 12px 0" }}>What are the compliance and data residency guarantees?</h4>
          <p style={{ color: "#888", margin: 0, lineHeight: 1.6 }}>
            Security is paramount. Safety Approach inherits our global compliance certifications, including SOC 2 Type II, ISO 27001, and HIPAA. Data can be pinned to specific geographic regions (e.g., EU-Central, US-East) to comply with local data sovereignty laws like GDPR and CCPA.

          <h4 style={{ color: "#fff", fontSize: "1.1rem", fontWeight: 500, margin: "0 0 12px 0" }}>Can Safety Approach be fine-tuned or customized?</h4>
          <p style={{ color: "#888", margin: 0, lineHeight: 1.6 }}>
            Yes. Enterprise customers receive access to our orchestration dashboard, allowing you to define custom system prompts, inject proprietary vector knowledge bases (RAG), and adjust the safety boundaries specifically for Safety Approach workflows.

          <h4 style={{ color: "#fff", fontSize: "1.1rem", fontWeight: 500, margin: "0 0 12px 0" }}>What is the pricing model?</h4>
          <p style={{ color: "#888", margin: 0, lineHeight: 1.6 }}>
            Usage is billed entirely on compute duration and token throughput. There are no seat licenses or hidden fees. We believe you should only pay for the exact amount of intelligence and execution Safety Approach consumes. Volume discounts trigger automatically at scale.
