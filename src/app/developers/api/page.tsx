        {/* FAQ Item 1 */}
        <BentoItem className="w-full text-left">
          <h4 style={{ color: "#fff", fontSize: "1.1rem", fontWeight: 500, margin: "0 0 12px 0" }}>How does API Reference integrate with existing infrastructure?</h4>
          <p style={{ color: "#888", margin: 0, lineHeight: 1.6 }}>
            API Reference is designed to be fully modular. It connects via standard REST/GraphQL endpoints and supports native event streaming through Kafka and WebSockets. For enterprise deployments, we provide a dedicated VPC peering option to ensure zero-latency data transfer.
          </p>
        </BentoItem>

        {/* FAQ Item 2 */}
        <BentoItem className="w-full text-left">
          <h4 style={{ color: "#fff", fontSize: "1.1rem", fontWeight: 500, margin: "0 0 12px 0" }}>What are the compliance and data residency guarantees?</h4>
          <p style={{ color: "#888", margin: 0, lineHeight: 1.6 }}>
            Security is paramount. API Reference inherits our global compliance certifications, including SOC 2 Type II, ISO 27001, and HIPAA. Data can be pinned to specific geographic regions (e.g., EU-Central, US-East) to comply with local data sovereignty laws like GDPR and CCPA.
          </p>

        {/* FAQ Item 3 */}
        <BentoItem className="w-full text-left">
          <h4 style={{ color: "#fff", fontSize: "1.1rem", fontWeight: 500, margin: "0 0 12px 0" }}>Can API Reference be fine-tuned or customized?</h4>
          <p style={{ color: "#888", margin: 0, lineHeight: 1.6 }}>
            Yes. Enterprise customers receive access to our orchestration dashboard, allowing you to define custom system prompts, inject proprietary vector knowledge bases (RAG), and adjust the safety boundaries specifically for API Reference workflows.
          </p>
        </BentoItem>

          <h4 style={{ color: "#fff", fontSize: "1.1rem", fontWeight: 500, margin: "0 0 12px 0" }}>What is the pricing model?</h4>
          <p style={{ color: "#888", margin: 0, lineHeight: 1.6 }}>
            Usage is billed entirely on compute duration and token throughput. There are no seat licenses or hidden fees. We believe you should only pay for the exact amount of intelligence and execution API Reference consumes. Volume discounts trigger automatically at scale.
